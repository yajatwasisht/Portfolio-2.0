# Portfolio-2.0

I enjoy crafting websites that aid business growth and software that makes lives easier; honing technology to better ease lives and improve the world I live in.  

I created this website to showcase my capabilities on the frontend and to deepen my understanding of **Framer Motion**, **GSAP**, and **SCSS**. I learned several things while building this site, and by exploring the code, you might also discover valuable insights to enhance your frontend development skills.
